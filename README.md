# Release Overview

I made a small Release Board to keep track of what's happening with our latest updates and where they're going. Our Sales Team asked for it so they could know what cool stuff the developers are working on.



## Technologies I used

 - Drag & Drop Tasks with **DnD Kit**
 - **Firebase** to store Tasks
 - **Typesript**
